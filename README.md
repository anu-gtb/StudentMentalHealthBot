# StudentMentalHealthBot

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a chatbot application for students that utilizes GPT-2 model for their basic mental health support and information.

The objectives of the Project are:
1. Create conversational AI chatbots for students with mental illnesses at their earliest point.
2. Allow student users to express and think about their emotions in a safe and anonymous way.
3. Provide guidance for addressing the most common mental health issues such as anxiety, stress and depression.

Implementation Steps:
1. Feeding GPT-2 model with relevant existing understanding-based on deep learning experience, about various forms of human psychological problems like marriages, career issues or family matters within a larger scope like frequently asked questions regarding general mental wellbeing.
2. Designing an API to offer a human interface by which human beings can seek solutions to their troubles.
3. Deployment
